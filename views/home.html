            <p> Muthoni Njoba started her lifelong love affair with make up at the tender age of 9 years! Her
                dreams of pursuing a career in make-up artistry began whilst studying her A-levels at Kingâ€™s
                College Taunton in Somerset, England however given the opportunity to fulfil her parents wish,
                she chose to complete an undergrad degree in Communications, Media and Culture at Oxford
                Brookes University, England. After graduating and moving home she pursued higher education
                in Human Resource Management while working at a leading Investment Firm in Nairobi. Two
                years later she took a leap of faith to follow her passion as a career and has never looked
                back.
